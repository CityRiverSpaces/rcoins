Identify continuous lines in a network using an approach based on the Continuity in Street Network (COINS) method[^1].

`rcoins` is a R (re)implementation of the COINS algorithm, which is also available in Python as a module of the [`momepy`](https://docs.momepy.org/en/latest/api/momepy.COINS.html) library or in its original version: [PratyushTripathy/COINS](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy/COINS).

## Installation

You can install the released version of rcoins from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rcoins")
```

You can install the development version of rcoins from the R terminal like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CityRiverSpaces/rcoins")
```

### Alternative installation using `conda`

An environment including rcoins and all its dependencies can be created using Conda (or its faster implementation Mamba).

Conda can be installed using the Miniforge scripts provided [here](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/) (download one of the Mambaforge scripts in order to install Mamba as well).

First clone this repository and access it:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/CityRiverSpaces/rcoins.git
cd rcoins/
```

Run `conda` (or `mamba`, if using Mambaforge) to create an environment with all the required dependencies:

``` shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate rcoins
```

Install the development version of rcoins (include `dependencies = TRUE` to install the example datasets):

``` shell
Rscript -e 'devtools::install(dependencies = TRUE)'
```

## Example

Given the street network of the city of Bucharest (data source: [OpenStreetMap][osm])

```{r}
library(rcoins)
bucharest <- get_example_data()
streets <- bucharest$streets
```

Plot streets: 

```{r streets, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
plot(sf::st_geometry(streets),
     col = sf::sf.colors(n = nrow(streets), categorical = TRUE),
     lwd = 2, xlim = c(418500, 437500), ylim = c(4909800, 4931500))
```

Determine continuous lines in the network as:

```{r}
continuous_streets <- stroke(streets)
```

Plot continuous streets:

```{r continuous-streets, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
plot(continuous_streets,
     col = sf::sf.colors(n = length(continuous_streets), categorical = TRUE),
     lwd = 2, xlim = c(418500, 437500), ylim = c(4909800, 4931500))
```
