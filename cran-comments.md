## Resubmission

This is a resubmission to solve problems identified by package checks on CRAN. Specifically, we have:

* Modified `get_example_data()` so that it fails gracefully if remote datasets are not reachable.

* Setup vignettes and tests so that they do not require access to remote datasets.

* Introduced a couple of small bug and metadata fixes (all changes are listed in NEWS.md).
