## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the reference style in the "Description" field of the DESCRIPTION file, which now reads:
  "... the Continuity in Street Networks (COINS) method from Tripathy (2021) <doi:10.1177/2399808320967680>, ..."

* Fixed the call to `on.exit()` to revert to previous user options (see `R/example_data.R` lines 21-22).

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
