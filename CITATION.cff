abstract: >-
   Provides functionality to group lines that form naturally continuous lines in
   a spatial network. The algorithm implemented is based on the Continuity in
   Street Networks (COINS) method <doi:10.1177/2399808320967680>, which identifies
   continuous "strokes" in the network as the line strings that maximize the angles
   between consecutive segments.
